The objective of this project was to customize an open-source project named Blockly-games. The project was cloned from its Github repository and was made running on the local machine. The functionality of three blocks - move forward, left and right was changed, and the new functionality of skip a block was added. The web application was hosted on GitHub pages after customization.
